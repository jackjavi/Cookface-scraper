The clubs are now working to finalise the last details of the deal. Tanganga was left out of Millwall's squad for yesterday's 1-0 win at the Blades. Millwall boss Alex Neil said Tanganga was absent due to talks over a move away progressing. Neil said: “The fact that I took him out of the game, obviously, things have moved on. \"As far as I know, things are not at a conclusion stage just now. I had a good chat with Japhet earlier today. So we’ll see what transpires over the next couple of days.”",
