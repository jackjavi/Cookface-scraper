# Comprehensive SOCKS Proxy Sources (No Limits)

## Updated Configuration - ALL Non-HTTP Proxies

The system now fetches from **20+ SOCKS proxy sources** with **NO LIMITS** on proxy count.

### Proxy Sources Included

#### Proxifly Sources (High Quality)
- SOCKS5 JSON format
- SOCKS4 JSON format  
- SOCKS5 TXT format
- SOCKS4 TXT format

#### TheSpeedX Sources (Active Lists)
- SOCKS5 list
- SOCKS4 list

#### Community Maintained Sources
- HookZof SOCKS5
- Monosans SOCKS5 & SOCKS4
- ProxyList mixed format
- ShiftyTR SOCKS5 & SOCKS4
- ProxySpace SOCKS5 & SOCKS4
- ALIILAPRO SOCKS5 & SOCKS4

#### Additional Sources for Maximum Coverage
- Official KangProxy SOCKS5 & SOCKS4
- Proxy List SOCKS5 & SOCKS4
- Advanced format parsers for mixed lists

### Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Proxy Limits**
   ```typescript
   maxProxies: 999999, // No limit - fetch ALL available
   ```

2. **Increased Minimum Working Proxies**
   ```typescript
   minWorkingProxies: 20, // Up from 5
   ```

3. **Expanded Source List**
   - 20+ active SOCKS proxy sources
   - Both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols
   - Multiple formats (JSON, TXT, mixed)

4. **Enhanced Parsing**
   - Added advanced parser for mixed format lists
   - Better protocol detection
   - Improved validation

### Expected Results

**Before (Limited):**
- Maximum 200 proxies fetched
- Limited to 6-8 sources
- Conservative approach

**After (Unlimited):**
- ALL available SOCKS proxies fetched
- 20+ sources accessed
- Expected 1000-5000+ proxies per fetch
- Higher success rates due to larger pool

### Usage Impact

```bash
# Single fetch now gets ALL available proxies
npm run proxy-fetch-only

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Fetch complete - NO LIMITS APPLIED:
# üìä Sources accessed: 18/20
# üì¶ Total fetched: 3,247
# üéØ Unique proxies: 2,891  
# üíæ ALL 2,891 unique proxies saved to list
```

### Resource Considerations

**Disk Space:** Each proxy entry is ~200-500 bytes
- 1000 proxies ‚âà 500KB
- 5000 proxies ‚âà 2.5MB
- 10000 proxies ‚âà 5MB

**Memory:** JSON parsing and processing
- 1000 proxies ‚âà 1-2MB RAM during processing
- 5000 proxies ‚âà 5-10MB RAM during processing

**Network:** Initial fetch from all sources
- ~500KB-2MB total download per fetch cycle
- Sources accessed with 1-second delays (respectful)

### Testing Strategy

With unlimited proxies, testing approach becomes more important:

1. **Progressive Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run proxy-fetch-only    # Get all proxies
   npm run proxy-test-only     # Test them systematically
   ```

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Tests proxies one by one (resource-friendly)
   - Saves progress every 10 proxies
   - Automatic cleanup of failed proxies

3. **Expected Success Rate**
   - With more proxies: 10-30% success rate is normal
   - 3000 proxies ‚Üí 300-900 working proxies
   - Much better than limited 200 ‚Üí 20-60 working

### Monitoring Large Proxy Lists

```bash
# Check total counts
npm run proxy-stats

# Example output:
# üìÅ MAIN FILE (Testing Queue):
#    üì¶ Total: 2,891
#    ‚ùì Untested: 2,891
# 
# üèÜ SUCCESS FILE (Validated Working):  
#    üì¶ Total working: 0 (ready for testing)
#
# üåê SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
#    üìä Total working proxies: 0
#    üì¶ Total system proxies: 2,891
```

### Performance Optimization

The system handles large proxy lists efficiently:

- **Streaming processing** during testing
- **Memory cleanup** after each proxy test
- **Progress saving** every 10 proxies tested
- **Automatic deduplication** before saving
- **Sorting by performance** in success file

Now you'll get ALL available SOCKS proxies from the internet instead of being limited to just 200!
